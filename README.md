# General
Project completed as part of Principles of Digital Design (CMPE 212). Final project focused on designing and implementing a 7-segment decoder using digital logic and Verilog.

# About 7-Segment Decoder
Designed a 7-segment display decoder that converts 3-bit binary inputs (000–111) into their decimal digit representation on a 7-segment LED.
  - Created truth tables and Karnaugh maps for each segment to derive minimized Boolean expressions.
  - Implemented the design using 74LS series logic ICs (AND, OR, NOT, XOR) on a breadboard and verified all outputs.
  - Developed a structural Verilog model and testbench on EDA Playground to simulate and validate the decoder’s functionality.
  - Focused on applying concepts of Boolean logic, circuit design, hardware debugging, and HDL simulation.
